        des: "In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Lewis Carroll created fantastic worlds that continue to delight and trouble Readers of all ages today. Few consider, however, that Carroll conceived his Alice Books during the 1860s, a moment of intense intellectual upheaval, as new scientific, linguistic, educational, and mathematical ideas flourished around him and far beyond. Alice in Space reveals the contexts within which the Alice Books first lived, bringing back the zest to jokes lost over Time and poignancy to hidden references. Gillian Beer explores Carroll's Work through the speculative gaze of Alice, for whom no authority is unquestioned and everything can speak. Parody and Punch, evolutionary debates, philosophical dialogues, educational works for children, Math and logic, manners and rituals, dream Theory and childhood studies all fueled the fireworks. While much has been written about Carroll's Biography and his influence on Children's literature, Beer convincingly shows him at play in the spaces of Victorian cultural and intellectual life, Drawing on then current controversies, reading prodigiously across many fields, and writing on multiple Levels to please both Children and adults in different ways. With a welcome combination of learning and lightness, Beer reminds us that Carroll's Books are essentially about curiosity, its risks and pleasures. Along the way, Alice in Space shares Alice's exceptional ability to spark curiosity in us, too."

Sometimes, they feel like nothing is difficult than Mathematics. Is it real? In fact, Mathematics is an easy subject if you know how to learn it. A technique to learn Mathematics is self-studying. There are a lot of strategies in doing Mathematics self-learning. I am going to show you a wonderful strategy here. There are three important Tools that you must know to improve your Math skill; they are mastering Basic concepts, choosing suitable Books and learning Mathematics meaning. Mastering Basic concepts is the first tool that you have to learn. We cannot understand something deeply if we have no Basic concepts or our Basic concepts is not completely developed. In addition, thinking can process if only there are Basic concepts. Likewise, when we learn Mathematics, we have to think. If we have no Basic concepts, we cannot process our thinking. For example, before we learn to multiple numbers, we have to understand how to sum numbers. If we have no concepts in summing numbers, we will not understand about how to multiple numbers.

But to wildlife scientists, many of whom have not been formally trained as biometricians, computer modelers, or mathematicians, the wide array of available techniques for analyzing wildlife populations and habitats can be overwhelming. This practical book aims to help students and professionals alike understand how to use quantitative methods to inform their work in the field. Covering the most widely used contemporary approaches to the analysis of wildlife populations and habitats, Quantitative Analyses in Wildlife Science is divided into five broad areas: * General statistical methods* demographic estimation* Dynamic process modeling* analysis of spatially based data on animals and resources* numerical methods Addressing a variety of topics, from population estimation and growth trend predictions to the study of migration patterns, this book presents fresh data on such pressing issues as sustainable take, control of invasives, and species reintroduction. Authored by leading researchers in wildlife science, each chapter considers the structure of data in relation to a particular analytical technique, as well as the structure of variation in those data. Providing conceptual and quantitative overviews of modern analytical methods, the techniques covered in this book also apply to conservation research and wildlife policy. Whether a quick refresher or a comprehensive introduction is called for, Quantitative Analyses in Wildlife Science is an indispensable addition to every wildlife professional's bookshelf.

On attaining desired height, he leaves the pole and concentrates on crossing the bar. Similarly, a Gunaateet must use Sattv Gun like a pole only to lift him up spiritually, and leave it upon reaching requisite height to cross over the bar of the world. Sattv is his pole, not the goal"    },

For some of the real story, and for a great American tale in itself, you want to go to Jack Goldsmiths book, In Hoffas Shadow.” ―Peggy Noonan, The Wall Street Journal"In Hoffas Shadow is compulsively readable, deeply affecting, and truly groundbreaking in its re-examination of the Hoffa case . . . a monumental achievement. ―James Rosen, The Wall Street JournalAs a young man, Jack Goldsmith revered his stepfather, longtime Jimmy Hoffa associate Chuckie OBrien. But as he grew older and pursued a career in Law and government, he came to doubt and distance himself from the man long suspected by the FBI of perpetrating Hoffas disappearance on behalf of the mob. It was only years later, when Goldsmith was serving as assistant attorney General in the George W. Bush administration and questioning its misuse of surveillance and other powers, that he began to reconsider his stepfather, and to understand Hoffas true legacy. In Hoffas Shadow tells the moving story of how Goldsmith reunited with the stepfather hed disowned and then set out to unravel one of the twentieth centurys most persistent mysteries and Chuckies role in it. Along the way, Goldsmith explores Hoffas rise and fall and why the golden age of blue-collar America came to an end, while also casting new light on the century-old surveillance state, the architects of Hoffas disappearance, and the heartrending complexities of love and loyalty.

        des: "There is perhaps no political figure in modern History who did more to secure and protect the Indian nation than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. But, ironically, seventy years after Patel brought together piece by piece the map of India by fusing the princely states with British India to create a new democratic, independent nation, little is understood or appreciated about Patel's enormous contribution to the making of India. Caricatured in political debate, all the nuances of Patel's difficult life and the daring choices he made are often lost, or worse, used as mere polemic. If Mahatma Gandhi was the spiritual core of India's freedom struggle and Jawaharlal Nehru its romantic idealism, it was Sardar Patel who brought in the vital pragmatism which held together the national movement and the first ideas of independent India. A naturally stoic man, Patel, unlike Gandhi or Nehru, wrote no Personal History. He famously argued that its was better to create History than write it. This is why even his deepest misgivings and quarrels have been easily buried. But every warning that Patel left for India - from the dangers of allowing groups to create private militias to his thoughtful criticism on India's approach to Kashmir, Pakistan and China - are all dangerously relevant today. It is impossible to read about Patel, who died in 1950, and not feel that had he lived on, India might have been a different country. It is also impossible to ignore Patel and understand not only what the idea of India is but also what it could have been, and might be in the future. The Man Who Saved India is a sweeping, magisterial retelling of Sardar Patel's story. With fiercely detailed and pugnacious anecdotes, multiple award-winning, best-selling writer Hindol Sengupta brings alive Patel's determined life of struggle and his furious commitment to keep India safe. This book brings alive all the arguments, quarrels and clashes between some of the most determined People in Indian History and their battle to carve out an independent nation. Through ravages of a failing body broken by decades of abuse in and outside prison, Patel Stands out in this book as the man who, even on his Death bed, worked to save India. Hindol Sengupta's The Man Who Saved India is destined to define Patel's legacy for Future generations."

This book is essential reading for every journalist and aspiring journalist the world over. —John le Carré “A master class in the craft of reporting. —Alan Rusbridger, The New York Times Book ReviewFrom the Pulitzer Prize-winning, best-selling author and preeminent investigative journalist of our time—a heartfelt, hugely revealing memoir of a decades-long career breaking some of the most impactful stories of the last half-century, from Washington to Vietnam to the Middle East.Seymour Hersh's fearless reporting has earned him fame, front-page bylines in virtually every major newspaper in the free world, honors galore, and no small amount of controversy. Now in this memoir he describes what drove him and how he worked as an independent outsider, even at the nation's most prestigious publications. He tells the stories behind the stories—riveting in their own right—as he chases leads, cultivates sources, and grapples with the weight of what he uncovers, daring to challenge official narratives handed down from the powers that be. In telling these stories, Hersh divulges previously unreported information about some of his biggest scoops, including the My Lai massacre and the horrors at Abu Ghraib. There are also illuminating recollections of some of the giants of American Politics and journalism: Ben Bradlee, A. M. Rosenthal, David Remnick, and Henry Kissinger among them. This is essential reading on the power of the printed word at a time when good journalism is under fire as never before."
